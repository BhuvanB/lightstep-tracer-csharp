# lightstep-tracer-csharp
The LightStep distributed tracing library for C#

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/LightStep.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LightStep) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/lightstep/lightstep-tracer-csharp.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/lightstep/lightstep-tracer-csharp)

# Development Requirements
- C# 7
- .NET Core 2+
- .NET 4.5

This translates to requiring at least Visual Studio 2017 (15.0).
You may need [PostSharp](https://www.postsharp.net/) to work on the `LightStep.CSharpAspectTestApp`.

## MacOS
Due to an issue with Cake's detection of the `msbuild` path, the Mono Framework needs to be installed via its installer and **not** Homebrew.

# Installation
Install the package via NuGet into your solution, or use `Install-Package LightStep`.

# Basic Usage
It's recommended to initialize the tracer once at the beginning of your application and assign it as the global tracer, as follows:
```c#
// substitute your own LS API Key here
var lsKey = "TEST_TOKEN";

// substitute your satellite endpoint (host, port) here.
var lsSettings = new SatelliteOptions("localhost", 9996, false);

// create a new tracer and register it
var tracer = new Tracer(new Options(lsKey, lsSettings));
GlobalTracer.Register(tracer);
...
```

Once you've initialized a tracer, you can begin to create and emit spans.

Please refer to the [OpenTracing C# documentation](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-csharp) for information on how to create spans.

You can also refer to the `examples` folder for sample code and projects. 

# Advanced Usage

There's several options that can be adjusted when instantiating a `LightStepTracer`.

## `Options`
| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Tags   | Default tags to apply to all spans created by the tracer.  |
| ReportPeriod  | How frequently the Tracer should batch and send Spans to LightStep (30s default) |
| ReportTimeout  | Timeout for sending spans to the Satellite  |
| AccessToken | The LightStep Project Access Key |
| Tags | Tags that are applied to each span generated by the tracer. Override or add new tags via the constructor. |
| Satellite | A SatelliteOptions object that specifies the host, port, and if we should use HTTPS |
| UseHttp2 | If this is true, we use HTTP/2 to communicate with the Satellite |

## `SatelliteOptions`
| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| SatelliteHost | The hostname of a Satelite (i.e., `collector.lightstep.com`)
| SatellitePort | The port number where the Satellite is listening for HTTP traffic (defaults to 443)
| UsePlaintext | Should we use HTTP or HTTPS traffic? (Defaults to HTTP)

The C# Tracer _only_ supports Protobuf over HTTP/S, so no options to modify the transport are available.

The C# Tracer will prefer TLS 1.2 when available on all .NET Runtime versions, but should fall back to TLS 1.1 or 1.0 in that order.

The following is an example of overriding the LightStep Component Name and adding a new custom tag for all spans -

```csharp
var satelliteOptions = newSatelliteOptions("satellite.mydomain.com");
var overrideTags = new Dictionary<string, object> 
{
    {LightStepConstants.ComponentNameKey, "test_component"},
    {"my_tag", "foobar"}
};
var tracerOptions = new Options("TEST_TOKEN", overrideTags, satelliteOptions);
var tracer = new Tracer(tracerOptions, satelliteOptions);
```
